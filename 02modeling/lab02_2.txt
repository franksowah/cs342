Exercise 2.2

a. The constraint that requires that all movies having a non-NULL score value must also have more than 1000 votes is:
		CHECK (Score is NULL OR votes > 1000)
		This constraint requires that all movies whose score is a NULL value hav any number of votes. 
		For movis whose scores are not NULL, it requires that the number of votes be 1000.

b.	We would seperate the contraint if we want to add a unique constraint to a particular column.
