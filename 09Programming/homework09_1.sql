/*
My first query was done without an index without tuning.
I used an index on the MovieDirector table for the second query, and an index on the
Director table for the third query.
The query using the index on the moviedirector table had the best average run time.
In query 2, the database does a 'Table Access by Index RowID' operation on the MovieDirector instead of a 'Table Access Full'.
In query 3, the database does a 'Table Access by Index RowID' operation on the Director instead of a 'Table Access Full'.
I choose query 2 because the index used on the MovieDirector table makes the run time faster than the two.
Query 2 doesnâ€™t use a 'Table Access Full'.
