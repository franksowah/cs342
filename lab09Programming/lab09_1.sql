The order of the tables listed in the FROM clause do not affect the way Oracle executes a join query.
Both execution plan outputs match.
A TABLE ACCESS FULL is executed on the tables in an order chosen by Oracle.
Therefore Oracles determines a join order and uses it irrespective of how the tables are listed in the FROM Clause.
