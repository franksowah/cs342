a. Columns needed to be updated:- Major- Course number - Prerequisite number- Departmentb. Splitting the departments and course_numbers so that cs342 become ‘cs’ ‘342’.
The prerequisite table will also have to be split and a department column added to it.
So a department column will be added to both the SECTION and PREREQUISITE tables.

c. It is not possible to restructure the schema such that only one field needs to be updated. Each column and table needs to maintain integrity.
