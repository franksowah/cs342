Consider the ERD given in Figure 3.21 (The AIRLINE database schema):a. Based on what you see in the diagram, explain the difference between flights, flight legs, and leg instances. Please give a short explanatory paragraph.- Flight is the airline you’ll be traveling with and the days available to travel- Flight leg is the departure and arrival to and from an airport during scheduled times.- Leg instance is an instance of a flight leg on a specific date. IT is a particular occurrence.b. The names of some of the attributes in this diagram are underlined with dotted lines. You’ll note that this notation is not explained in the Figure 3.14 cheatsheet. What does it mean?- It means the attribute is a partial key. It must be used in conjunction with the attribute in question to uniquely identify instances of a corresponding entity set.c. You’ll note that the “SEAT” entity has a total participation in the “RESERVATION” relationship (i.e., we would write the cardinality constraint {1,*} on the “LEG_INSTANCE” side of the relationship). Why do you think the database modelers did it this way?- I think it’s because many seats can be reserved in each flight leg instance but a seat is reserved form one individual.
