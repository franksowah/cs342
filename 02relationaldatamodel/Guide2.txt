Chapter 5 (focus primarily on Sections 5.1–5.2)a. Who invented the relational data model? When and where did they do their work?- Edgar F. Codd, 1970s.b. Explain the following terms:- Relation: is a set of tuples where each element is a member of a data domain.- Attribute: an attribute refers to a database component, such a table. It also may refer to a database field- Domain: refers to all the values which a data element may contain.- n-tuple: a tuple can be considered as a set of (<attribute>, <value>) pairs, where each pair gives the value of the mapping from an attribute Ai to a value vi from dom(Ai).- NULL value: is used to signify missing or unknown values.- primary, foreign, candidate and super keys:  A Primary Key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identify a record. A Candidate Key can be any column or a combination of columns that can qualify as unique key in database. a foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that uniquely identifies a row of another table or the same table.- referenced and referencing recordsc. Are tuples in a relation ordered? How about attribute values in a tuple? Explain why or why not.- Mathematically, elements of a set have no order among them: tuples in a relation do not have any particular order. In other words, a relation is not sensitive to the ordering of tuples. Tuple ordering is not part of a relation definition because a relation attempts to represent facts at a logical or abstract level.d. Can attributes have multiple values in a single n-tuple? Why or why not?-  No, because each value is not divisible into components –each value in a tuple is atomic.
