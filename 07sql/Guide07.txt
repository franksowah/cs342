CREATE VIEW Movie_View AS
SELECT title, year

b.
Base tables: A base table is a physical structure that contains stored records.

Join Views: A view that involves multiple tables joined together.

Updateable Join Views: Join views that can be updated to reflect changes to the data in the table.

Key-Preserved Tables: A table is key-preserved if every key of the table can also be a key of the result of the join.

Query Modification: Modifying or transforming the view query into a query on the underlying base tables.

Materialization: Physically creating a temporary or permanent view table when the view is first queried or created, and keeping that table
                 on the assumption that other queries on the view will follow.

Relational Algebra (read Sections 8.1–8.3 & 8.5) — Write a simple query on the movies database using SELECT (σcondition),
PROJECT (πfieldlist), RENAME (ρnewName) and JOIN (⋈condition)
(see example queries 1 & 2 in Section 8.5).

  Movie_stars← σtitle=‘Star Wars’(Movie)
  Movie_Actors ← (Movie_Stars ⋈ Movie.ID=Casting.movieID)
  RESULT ← πfirstName(Movie_Actors)


b.
Tuple Relational Calculus (read Sections 8.6.1–8.6.3 & 8.6.8) — Write a simple query on the movies database using the
tuple relational calculus queries (see example queries 0 & 1 in Section 8.6.4).

 - {p.firstName, p.lastName | Performer(p) AND (∃c)(Casting(c) AND p.id = c.performerID)}

Define the following terms):

c.
Existential and universal quantifiers (see Section 8.6.3).
  - (∀x) asserts that the property or relation holds for all members of the domain.
  - ∃(x) means that there exists (at least one) object having a particular property.

safe expressions (see Section 8.6.8).
  - A safe expression in relational calculus is one that is guaranteed to
    yield a finite number of tuples as its result.
