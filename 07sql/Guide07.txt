Base tables: A base table is a physical structure that contains stored records.

Join Views: A view that involves multiple tables joined together.

Updateable Join Views: Join views that can be updated to reflect changes to the data in the table.

Key-Preserved Tables: A table is key-preserved if every key of the table can also be a key of the result of the join.

Query Modification: Modifying or transforming the view query into a query on the underlying base tables.

Materialization: Physically creating a temporary or permanent view table when the view is first queried or created, and keeping that table
                 on the assumption that other queries on the view will follow.
