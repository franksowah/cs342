Emmanuel BoyePop Music Guild Database:My vision for this project is to create a database for a music guild at Calvin College to handle all information related to members of the guild.  Artiste, their songs, lyrics, genre of music, Guild leaders, and anybody else associated with the guild.This database will include tables like artiste, leader, music etc. The potential stakeholders for this database will be students, the college, and professors.
