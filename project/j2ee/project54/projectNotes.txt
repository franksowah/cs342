My JPA-based, RESTful WebService project application provides all information related to the artistes
and the band they might be a part of, and their performances. An artiste can perform many times,
but each performance can take only one artiste.
This information is useful because it can help mentors manage better the artiste, and make scheduling easier for the guild.
